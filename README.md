# user-management-crud
my first crud project using node.js and mysql

Im sure ya'll already know how to use the node js. but if you dont, heres how

create a main folder that will store all of these files

open it in vscode and go to the terminal

paste this on the command: npm init -y 

then this: npm install express mysql2 body-parser

and run the app with: node app.js

you should get something like 
"Connected to the MySQL database.
Server is running on http://localhost:3000"

(Before doing all this, make sure youve already created a MySQL database. in this case i use MySQL workbench)
